Fanmade sequel to Ant Life

Run `make all` to build single index.html file with most resources embedded as base64 strings. Still working on getting the fonts in. To serve this file over the internet, you need the `font` and `icons` directories, and `manifest.json`.

Please note that to build this you need `make`, `uglifyjs`, and `uglifycss`, and `base64.sh` must be given executable permissions.

This is incomplete, and most gameplay functionality has not been implemented yet.

The game is live at [holanet](https://holanet.xyz/v/ant/).
